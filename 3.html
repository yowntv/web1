  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[7] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted
    programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed,
    prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World
    Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web
    applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[9] and all major web browsers
    have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
