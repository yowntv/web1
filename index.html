  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>

     The World Wide Web (WWW), also called the Web, is an information space where documents
     and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked
     by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee
     invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed
     at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other
     research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet
     in August 1991.
